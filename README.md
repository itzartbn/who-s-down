# 👀 Who's Down Application

A simple and powerful tool to check which **servers**, **gateways**, **switches**, **routers**, or **computers** are down in your network — **in seconds**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Instantly detect unresponsive devices in your network.
- ⚡ Multithreaded pinging for lightning-fast results.
- 🧠 Automates the tedious process of manually checking server availability.
- 📄 Easy-to-configure `servers.txt` for managing your devices.
- 🧑‍💻 CLI-based tool — **GUI coming soon!**

---

## 📂 How to Use

1. Add your device names and IP addresses into a file called `servers.txt` using this format:

    ```
    cloudflare 1.1.1.1
    amazon 52.94.236.248
    ```

2. Run the script/application.

3. It will ping all the IPs **simultaneously** and show which ones are **not responding**.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The script automates the basic `ping` process.
- It takes every IP address from your `servers.txt` and sends out ping requests **in parallel**.
- Any device that **fails to respond** will be listed as **down**.
- No need to wait — everything happens almost instantly thanks to **multithreading**.

---

## 🌟 Why It’s Special

Traditional automation often pings devices one by one — which can be **slow** in large networks.

This script:
- Pings **all devices at once**
- Returns results in **just seconds**, even with **hundreds of IPs**
- Saves your time, effort, and sanity 🔥

## 🖥️ GUI Coming Soon!

A clean graphical interface is on the way to make this even easier to use. Stay tuned!

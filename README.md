Who's Down Application

  This application allows you to check which servers/Gateways/switches/routers/computers are down in your network in seconds.

How to use
  add your server names and IP addresses into the servers.txt file in the following method
    cloudflare 1.1.1.1
    amazon 52.94.236.248

How this works
  This application/script have fully automated the ping process we does in day today life when we checking for servers and devices availability.
  This script pings every IP address you've supplied and return the device name thats not reply for the ping request.

Why Special
  When we say automating we can imagine pinging one after another like we usually do and that will probably take longer time if your network have hundreds of servers and devices.
  So the special thing about this script is multithread all the ping requests and return you the feedback in seconds.yes, thats it. Don't matter how many servers we have. it pings all at once.

GUI coming soon!!!!!
